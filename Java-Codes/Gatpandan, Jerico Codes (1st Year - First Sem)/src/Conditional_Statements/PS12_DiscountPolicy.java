/*
12.	Discount Policy. Keith’s Sheet Music needs a program to implement its music teacher’s discount policy.
The program is to prompt the user to enter the purchase total and to indicate whether the purchaser is a teacher.
The store plans to give each customer a printed receipt, so your program is to create a nicely formatted display output. Music teachers receive a 10% discount on their sheet music purchases unless the purchase total is $100 or higher.
In that case, the discount is 12%. The discount calculation occurs before addition of the 5% sales tax. Here are two sample output – one for a teacher and one for a non-teacher.

Total Purchases				        $122.00
Teacher’s discount (12%)		    14.64
Discounted total				    107.36
Sales tax (5%)				    	5.37
TOTAL					        	$112.73

Total Purchases				        $24.90
Sales tax (5%)				   	    1.25
TOTAL						        $26.15
