/*
13.	Cable Company Billing. Write a program that calculates a customerâ€™s bill for a local cable company. There are two types of customers: Residential and Business.

For residential customers, the following rates apply:
Bill Processing Fee: $4.50
Basic Service Fee: $20.50
Premium Channels: $7.50 per channel

For business customers, the following rates apply:
Bill Processing Fee: $15.00
Basic Service Fee: $75.00 for the first 10 connections; $5.00 for each additional connection
Premium Channels: $50.00 per channel for any number of connections

The program should ask the user for an account number (an integer) and a customer code. Assume that R or r stands for RESIDENTIAL customer, and B or b for a business customer.
