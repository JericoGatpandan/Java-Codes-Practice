/*
9.	Ordered Number. A 4-digit number WXYZ is called an ordered number if the difference between the first two digits, WX and the last two digits, YZ, WX-YZ =1 or YZ-WX =1. For example, 1213 and 4645 are ordered no., while 2346 and 7685 are not ordered numbers
Write a program that will accept a 4-digit number and will determined if it is an ordered
number. Test your program with numbers 1213, 2345, 999 and 4645.
