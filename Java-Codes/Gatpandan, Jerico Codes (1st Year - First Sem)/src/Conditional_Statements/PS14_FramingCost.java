/*
14.	Framing Cost. You have several pictures of different sizes that you would like to frame. A local picture framing store offers two types of frames - regular and fancy. The frames are available in white and can be ordered in any color the customer desires. Suppose that each frame is 1 inch wide. The cost of coloring the frame is $0.10 per inch. The cost of the regular frame is $0.15 per inch and the cost of a fancy frame is $0.25 per inch. The cost of putting a cardboard paper behind the picture is $0.02 per square inch and the cost of putting glass on top of the picture is $0.07 per square inch. The customer can also choose to put crowns on the corners, which costs $0.35 per crown.

Write a program that prompts the user to input the following information and then output the cost of framing the picture:
a.	the length and width, in inches, of the picture
b.	the type of the frame
c.	customerâ€™s choice of color to color the frame
d.	if the user wants to add the crowns, then the number of crowns
