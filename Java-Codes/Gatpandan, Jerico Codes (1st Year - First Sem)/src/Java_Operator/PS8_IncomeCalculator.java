8.	Income Calculator. You found an exciting summer job for five weeks. It pays $15.50 per hours. Suppose that the total tax you pay on your summer job income is 14%. After paying the taxes, you spend 10% of your net income to buy new clothes and other accessories for the next school year and 1% to buy school supplies. After buying clothes and school supplies, you use 25% of the remaining money to buy savings bond. For each dollar you spend to buy savings bond, your parents spend $0.50 to buy additional savings bond for you.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of hours worked each week. The program then outputs the following:
a) Your income before(GROSS) and after(NET) taxes from your summer job
b) the amount of tax you pay
c) the money you spend on clothes and other accessories
d) the money you spend on school supplies
e) the money you spend to buy savings bonds
f) the money your parents spend to buy additional savings bond for you
g) the total remaining money you have from your summer job income
